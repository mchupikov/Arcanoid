# Arcanoid
## project by mchupikov (Максим Чупіков)
### Arcanoid is a retro videogame developed by Taito in 1986. The game based on games of Brakeout series by Atari. The game was released in some versions for different platforms, including arcade machines, 8-bit home computers, gaming consoles and 16-bit computers.
### What about developing??? For developing my game I used pygame library. Nothing was difficult for me, but there are many objects, variables and remarks for each string of my code.
### The rules of game
1. You can move platform by arrows (left, right) or by a and d keys

2. The ball bounces off platform. If it fall under platform - GAME OVER.
